/**
 * Checks that the Tesseract our OCR calls actually reach is the one Legerix extracted for us.
 *
 * <p>Two distinct things can go wrong, and neither is visible from Legerix's own success:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>The consumer path binds a different library.</b> {@code Legerix.loadNatives()} loads its
 *     file by absolute path, which always succeeds. tess4j separately resolves the <em>short
 *     name</em> {@code tesseract} through JNA at its own static init, and can land on a system
 *     copy instead — silently, with OCR still returning plausible text. Legerix's own assertion
 *     cannot see this: it validates the file it extracted, not the one the consumer bound.</li>
 * <li><b>Legerix extracts our natives, not its own.</b> Its extraction reads
 *     {@code getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource()} — the jar containing {@code Legerix.class}.
 *     When we shade Legerix into a fat jar, that is <em>our</em> jar, so it extracts everything
 *     under the tier directory we ship, including natives Legerix never published.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Nothing here fails a startup or a capture. Wrong-library binding is a diagnosis problem, not
 * a crash, and the whole point is that it is currently invisible — so this reports and moves on.
